## Introduction

ModSync is a multi-mod installer for KOTOR 1 and 2. Its purpose is to allow a user to select the mods they want for install, and choose the options/customizations for each mod, handling the dependencies/custom instruction steps automatically.

### The Problem

Many users that are new to KOTOR don't understand KOTOR's unique modding limitations. They may be used to Vortex or the Steam workshop, and not understand why they can't just simply install mods A→B→C→D and uninstall mod B. KOTOR's modding architecture and tools strongly rely on install order, which prevents users from safely uninstalling a mod later in their install process - this can be catastrophic if a user only finds out after the fact that they no longer want a certain mod, because they would be forced to restart the entire modding process just to take it out. When installing dozens upon dozens of mods, these problems can quickly become overwhelming.

### ModSync's Solution

ModSync is a tool that allows the user to simply SELECT the mods they want and press a single 'install all' button. That's all an end user should have to do. There's plenty of installers around (installshield, InnoSetup, Wix etc) that have simple installers that'll show a list of components to install. The user can simply select the ones they want and spam the next button until the thing finishes. So, why not KOTOR?

That's the goal here. In order to do this, we need someone to define the instructions. I've seen plenty of batch installers outdated by various mod updates or changes. They sound like a pain to upkeep. So this isn't the way to go either. We need an easy way to *create* instructions. Given this, ModSync is designed to save and load an instruction file written in TOMLIN. TOMLIN was one of the easiest syntaxes to read/interpret by both machine and by human, allowing easy modifications and updates.

ModSync will allow you (or any mod collection author who chooses to utilize it) to create an instruction file and organize it inside of the tool itself. This means you can define what install steps to perform based on what other mods are being installed. Because ModSync is designed to manage the full installation process of all mods (so it can "see" everything you intend to use), the tool is a powerful assistant in determining what mods may or may not be compatible with one another. This way, if a mod changes or a mod collection creator wants to add another mod to their set, they already have a full list of changes that are happening in one handy location and can easily sort through them to determine whether a new mod will be functional with the existing setup. Not sure if your mod is compatible with another? Slap the 'untested' category on it and the user will be unable to select both unless they've also selected a Compatibility Level of 'Untested'.

## Install Process

The installer will install the selected (checked) mods in the left list from top to bottom when a user clicks 'Install All' following the instructions in the config file. Instructions will be ran in order. The installer does no verification of whether a user is using a vanilla installation of KOTOR, please keep this in mind when handling bug reports.

## Config File Structure

The TOMLIN instruction file contains is designed to organize the following mod information in a multi-mod environment. An individual mod has the following groupings:

- **Information**: the name, description, download link(s), authors, any identifying information. All mods are indexed by a GUID to ensure uniqueness in an instruction file.
- **Instructions**: A list of all instructions that need to be executed in order to install a mod. This includes specific instructions dependent on other mods (see the dependency section below)
- **Options**: User-customizeable features that this mod provides. For example, you might see that the 'Visually Repair HK-47' mod for K2 has two options: one that modifies appearance of both hk-47 and hk-50/51, and the other option modifies ONLY hk-47. These options are all redefined here.

### GUIDs

A GUID (Globally Unique Identifier) is a 128-bit number, which means it consists of 2^128 unique values. This is a very large number: 340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456.

So there are a total of 340 undecillion (short scale) or 340 sextillion (long scale) unique GUIDs.

## Mod Dependencies

A mod can be defined in the config as being compatible or incompatible with other mods/options. Each specific mod has the following dependency lists to support this:

- **Dependencies**: List of Mods/Options that are REQUIRED to be SELECTED for an install in order for THIS mod to install.
- **Restrictions**: List of Mods/Options that CANNOT BE SELECTED in order for THIS Specific mod to be installed. Basically the opposite of the above list. If anything is selected here, the mod won't install and will be skipped.
- **InstallAfter**: List of Mods/Options that must be installed BEFORE installing THIS mod. This mod must be installed after all of the mods/options in the list.
- **InstallBefore**: List of Mods/Options that must be installed AFTER installing THIS mod. This mod must be installed before all of the mods/options in the list. Adding a mod/option to the list will immediately reorder the left selection list to follow this requirement of install order.

## Instructions Overview

ModSync is capable of handling the following Actions:

- **Move** → Move a file to a folder
- **Copy** → Copy a file to a folder
- **Execute** → Execute an executable file
- **Patcher** → Execute a Patcher install from the given tslpatchdata directory path.
- **Rename** → Renames a file
- **Choose** → Defines an instruction that'll choose between a list of GUID options.
- **DelDuplicate** → An instruction that will deletes all files containing the specified extension, when the filenames duplicate.
- **Extract** → Extracts an archive. Currently supports [.7z, .rar, .zip, and 7zip .EXE] archives ONLY. 7z SFX executables (.exe) are extracted cross-platform by parsing the embedded 7z payload, with a CLI fallback (7z) on non-Windows systems if available.
- **Delete** → Deletes a file.

### Instruction Fields

All of these instructions have the following fields:

- **Source** → List of files to handle. If the instruction is 'Choose', this will instead be a list of GUIDs.
- **Destination** → Applicable to the 'Move', 'Copy', 'Rename', 'Patcher', and 'Delete' Actions ONLY. This will usually be a location in the install (kotor) directory, or in the case of rename it's the new filename to rename to.
- **Overwrite** → Applicable to the 'Move', 'Copy', and 'Rename' Actions ONLY. When 'True', means that the file will be overwritten, when false, means that the file will be skipped if it exists.
- **Dependencies** → List of Mods/Options that are REQUIRED to be SELECTED for this specific single instruction to run. If ANY of the mods/options in this list are not selected, this instruction will not be run.
- **Restrictions** → List of Mods/Options that CANNOT BE SELECTED in order for this specific single instruction to run. Basically the opposite of the above.
- **Arguments** → Applicable to the 'DelDuplicate', 'Execute', and 'Patcher' actions ONLY. For Patcher, this is the namespace option index listed in 'namespaces.ini' indexed based starting at 0 for the first option. For 'DelDuplicate', this is the extension of the files we want deleted if they duplicate. For 'Execute', this defines the extra command line arguments to send to the program before we launch it.

## Options

An Options is defined just like an individual mod, only nested in a real mod. In case that's not clear, it has the following properties:

Name, Description, Directions, Dependencies, Restrictions, InstallAfter, InstallBefore

If an option is incompatible with another option you simply need to add the other option into the Restrictions list for this option and do the same with the other option. E.g. if two options Option A and Option B are incompatible with each other, the Restrictions list of Option A will contain Option B, and the restrictions list of Option B will contain Option A. This makes it impossible for the user to install both with ModSync.

This can all be pretty overwhelming but what's important to understand is that ModSync is capable of following all the mods' convoluted installation steps in regards to other mods while still giving the user that one-click install-all approach that they deserve.

## Patcher Options

ModSync uses HoloPatcher internally, which allows us to install all selected mods in bulk, without bugging a user to click through multiple Patcher windows and praying they choose the correct option.

PyKotor and its frontend HoloPatcher installs mods significantly faster than TSLPatcher, and is supported on linux/mac!

## Detailed Instruction Type Reference

This section provides comprehensive documentation for each instruction type, including all properties/fields that are relevant and how they are used.

All instruction types support the following universal properties:

- **Dependencies**: List of Mod/Option GUIDs that must be selected for this instruction to run
- **Restrictions**: List of Mod/Option GUIDs that must NOT be selected for this instruction to run

### 1. Extract Instruction

**Purpose:** Extracts archive files to a destination directory.

**Supported Archive Formats:**

- .7z (7-Zip)
- .rar (WinRAR)
- .zip (ZIP archives)
- Self-extracting 7z .exe files (cross-platform support via embedded payload parsing)

**Properties:**

- **Action:** "Extract"
- **Source:** List of archive file paths to extract. Each path should point to an archive file.
  - Supports wildcards (*, ?) for pattern matching
  - Paths use placeholders: <<modDirectory>> or <<kotorDirectory>>
  - Multiple archives can be specified and will be extracted in order
- **Destination:** (Optional) Target directory where files should be extracted
  - If not specified, extracts to the same directory as the archive
  - Uses placeholders: <<modDirectory>> or <<kotorDirectory>>

**Behavior:**

- All files from the archive are extracted to the destination directory
- Preserves directory structure from within the archive
- Updates the Virtual File System during dry-run validation
- Logs the number of files extracted

**Example Usage:**

```toml
[[Instructions]]
Action = "Extract"
Source = ["<<modDirectory>>/MyMod_v1.2.zip"]
Destination = "<<modDirectory>>/MyMod"
```

### 2. Move Instruction

**Purpose:** Moves files from source location(s) to a destination directory.

**Properties:**

- **Action:** "Move"
- **Source:** List of file paths to move
  - Supports wildcards (*, ?) for pattern matching multiple files
  - Paths use placeholders: <<modDirectory>> or <<kotorDirectory>>
  - All matching files will be moved
- **Destination:** Target directory where files should be moved to
  - Must be a directory path, not a file path
  - Uses placeholders: <<modDirectory>> or <<kotorDirectory>>
  - Directory will be created if it doesn't exist (during real install)
- **Overwrite:** (Optional, default: true) Controls behavior when target file exists
  - true: Deletes existing file and moves the new file
  - false: Skips the file if it already exists at destination

**Behavior:**

- Files are moved (not copied) from source to destination
- Original file is removed from source location after successful move
- If destination file exists and Overwrite=true, destination file is deleted first
- If destination file exists and Overwrite=false, operation is skipped with a warning
- Preserves filename; only directory location changes

**Example Usage:**

```toml
[[Instructions]]
Action = "Move"
Source = ["<<modDirectory>>/extracted_files/*.tga"]
Destination = "<<kotorDirectory>>/Override"
Overwrite = true
```

**Auto-Extraction Feature:**
If source files are not found and the component has a ResourceRegistry, Move will automatically attempt to extract the missing files from archives listed in the registry.

### 3. Copy Instruction

**Purpose:** Copies files from source location(s) to a destination directory.

**Properties:**

- **Action:** "Copy"
- **Source:** List of file paths to copy
  - Supports wildcards (*, ?) for pattern matching multiple files
  - Paths use placeholders: <<modDirectory>> or <<kotorDirectory>>
  - All matching files will be copied

- Original file remains at source location (unlike Move)
- If destination file exists and Overwrite=true, destination file is deleted first
- If destination file exists and Overwrite=false, operation is skipped with a warning
- Preserves filename; only directory location changes

**Example Usage:**

```toml
[[Instructions]]
Action = "Copy"
Source = ["<<modDirectory>>/textures/*.tpc", "<<modDirectory>>/textures/*.tga"]
Destination = "<<kotorDirectory>>/Override"
Overwrite = false
```

**Auto-Extraction Feature:**

If source files are not found and the component has a ResourceRegistry, Copy will automatically attempt to extract the missing files from archives listed in the registry.

### 4. Rename Instruction

**Purpose:** Renames a file to a new filename in the same directory.

**Properties:**

- **Action:** "Rename"
- **Source:** List of file paths to rename
  - Supports wildcards (*, ?) for pattern matching
  - Paths use placeholders: <<modDirectory>> or <<kotorDirectory>>
  - Each matching file will be renamed to the same Destination filename
- **Destination:** New filename (not a path, just the filename with extension)
  - Should be just the filename, not a full path
  - The file will be renamed in its current directory
- **Overwrite:** (Optional, default: true) Controls behavior when target filename exists
  - true: Deletes existing file with the target name and performs rename
  - false: Skips the rename if target filename already exists

**Behavior:**

- Changes the filename while keeping the file in the same directory
- If target filename exists and Overwrite=true, existing file is deleted first
- If target filename exists and Overwrite=false, operation is skipped
- If source file doesn't exist, logs an error and continues
- Note: SetRealPaths is called with skipExistenceCheck=true for backward compatibility

**Example Usage:**

```toml
[[Instructions]]
Action = "Rename"
Source = ["<<kotorDirectory>>/Override/old_texture.tga"]
Destination = "new_texture.tga"
Overwrite = true
```

### 5. Delete Instruction

**Purpose:** Deletes specified files from the file system.

**Properties:**

- Action: "Delete"
- Source: List of file paths to delete
  - Supports wildcards (*, ?) for pattern matching
  - Paths use placeholders: `<<modDirectory>>` or `<<kotorDirectory>>`
  - All matching files will be deleted
- Destination: (Legacy/Optional) Not actively used for deletion target; delete operates on Source files
  - Historically serialized but not functionally used
  - Kept for backward compatibility with older TOML files
- Overwrite: (Special behavior) Controls error handling mode
  - true: Strict mode - logs warning and returns error code if file doesn't exist
  - false: Lenient mode (default) - silently skips missing files with verbose log only

**Behavior:**

- Deletes all files matching the Source patterns
- Files are permanently removed (not moved to recycle bin)
- If file doesn't exist and Overwrite=false: logs verbose message and continues
- If file doesn't exist and Overwrite=true: logs warning and sets error code
- SetRealPaths is called with skipExistenceCheck=true to allow deletion of non-existent files

**Example Usage:**

```toml
[[Instructions]]
Action = "Delete"
Source = ["<<kotorDirectory>>/Override/incompatible_*.tga"]
Overwrite = false
```

### 6. DelDuplicate Instruction

**Purpose:** Deletes duplicate files with different extensions but the same base filename. Useful for texture format conflicts (e.g., deleting .tpc when .tga exists).

**Properties:**

- Action: "DelDuplicate"
- Source: List of file extensions to consider as "compatible" (duplicates of each other)
  - Each entry should be a file extension (e.g., ".tpc", ".tga")
  - Files with any of these extensions are considered for duplicate detection
  - If not specified, defaults to Game.TextureOverridePriorityList
- Destination: Directory to scan for duplicate files
  - Must be a directory path
  - Uses placeholders: `<<modDirectory>>` or `<<kotorDirectory>>`
- Arguments: File extension to delete when duplicates are found
  - Should be a single extension (e.g., ".tpc")
  - When multiple files with the same base name exist, files with this extension are deleted
  - If not specified in Arguments, falls back to first entry in Source

**Behavior:**

- Scans the Destination directory for files
- Groups files by base filename (without extension)
- For each group with 2+ files having compatible extensions:
  - Deletes files matching the Arguments extension
  - Keeps files with other extensions
- Case sensitivity controlled by Arguments parameter (defaults to case-insensitive)
- SetRealPaths is called with sourceIsNotFilePath=true

**Example Usage:**

```toml
[[Instructions]]
Action = "DelDuplicate"
Source = [".tpc", ".tga", ".dds"]
Destination = "`<<kotorDirectory>>`/Override"
Arguments = ".tpc"
```

Common Use Case:
Deleting .tpc files when .tga versions exist, since KOTOR prioritizes .tga over .tpc.

### 7. Patcher Instruction

Purpose: Executes TSLPatcher/HoloPatcher installation using a tslpatchdata directory.

Properties:

- Action: "Patcher"
- Source: Path to the tslpatchdata directory or a file within it
  - Can be path to tslpatchdata folder itself
  - Can be path to a file inside tslpatchdata (directory is extracted automatically)
  - Uses placeholders: `<<modDirectory>>` or `<<kotorDirectory>>``
- Destination: (Legacy) Historically serialized but not actively used by patcher execution
  - Kept for backward compatibility
  - Patcher always targets MainConfig.DestinationPath
- Arguments: (Optional) Namespace option index for multi-option patchers
  - String representation of integer index (e.g., "0", "1", "2")
  - Corresponds to option index in namespaces.ini (0-based)
  - If specified, HoloPatcher will use --namespace-option-index parameter
  - If not specified, default option is used

**Behavior:**

- Locates HoloPatcher executable (prioritizes Python version, falls back to native)
- Modifies changes.ini automatically:
  - Sets PlaintextLog=1 to enable text-based logging
  - Sets LookupGameFolder=0 to prevent TSLPatcher from trying to automatically lookup kotor game installation folders
  - Sets ConfirmMessage=N/A to suppress confirmation dialogs
- Executes HoloPatcher with parameters:
  - --install
  - --game-dir="<DestinationPath>"
  - --tslpatchdata="<Source>"
  - --namespace-option-index=<Arguments> (if Arguments specified)
- Verifies installation by checking installlog.txt/installlog.rtf for errors
- Skips execution during dry-run validation (simulation mode)
- Returns error if HoloPatcher exit code is non-zero
- Returns TSLPatcherError if log contains "[Error]" entries

**Example Usage:**

```toml
[[Instructions]]
Action = "Patcher"
Source = ["<<modDirectory>>/MyMod/tslpatchdata"]
Arguments = "1"
```

Auto-Extraction Feature:
If source files are not found and the component has a ResourceRegistry, Patcher will automatically attempt to extract the missing tslpatchdata folder from archives.

### 8. Execute / Run Instructions

Purpose: Executes an external program or script. Both "Execute" and "Run" are functionally identical.

Properties:

- Action: "Execute" or "Run" (both are equivalent)
- Source: List of executable file paths to run
  - Can be .exe, .bat, .cmd, .sh, or any executable
  - Each executable in the list is run in sequence
  - Uses placeholders: `<<modDirectory>>` or `<<kotorDirectory>>`
- Arguments: (Optional) Command-line arguments to pass to the executable
  - Full argument string passed to the program
  - Supports placeholder replacement via ReplaceCustomVariables
  - Can include `<<modDirectory>>` and `<<kotorDirectory>>` in arguments
- Destination: Not used by Execute/Run instructions

**Behavior:**

- Executes each program in the Source list sequentially
- Waits for each program to complete before moving to the next
- Captures stdout and stderr output and logs it
- SetRealPaths is called with skipExistenceCheck=true
- If any executable returns non-zero exit code:
  - Logs the output and error streams
  - Returns ChildProcessError
  - Stops processing remaining executables
- Returns FileNotFoundPost if executable doesn't exist
- Not executed during dry-run validation (simulation mode)

**Example Usage:**

```toml
[[Instructions]]
Action = "Execute"
Source = ["<<modDirectory>>/MyMod/setup.exe"]
Arguments = "/silent /norestart"
```

Security Note:
Execute instructions can run arbitrary code. Only use instruction files from trusted sources.

### 9. Choose Instruction

Purpose: Executes instructions conditionally based on which Options are selected by the user.

Properties:

- Action: "Choose"
- Source: List of Option GUIDs (not file paths)
  - Each GUID corresponds to an Option defined in the component
  - When an Option is selected by the user, its instructions will be executed
  - Multiple GUIDs can be specified
- Destination: Not used (kept for serialization compatibility)
- Dependencies: (Optional) List of GUIDs that must be selected for this Choose instruction to run
- Restrictions: (Optional) List of GUIDs that must not be selected for this Choose instruction to run

**Behavior:**

- SetRealPaths is called with sourceIsNotFilePath=true
- Retrieves the list of selected Options whose GUIDs are in the Source list
- For each selected Option:
  - Executes all instructions defined in that Option
  - Executes them in sequence using ExecuteInstructionsAsync
  - If any Option's instructions fail, returns OptionalInstallFailed
- Options are processed in the order their GUIDs appear in Source
- Allows for conditional installation based on user choices
- Commonly used for "which texture variant do you want?" scenarios

**Example Usage:**

```toml
[[Instructions]]
Action = "Choose"
Source = ["a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890", "f9e8d7c6-b5a4-3210-9876-543210fedcba"]
```

How Options Work:
Options are defined separately with their own Name, Description, and Instructions. The user sees these as selectable choices in the UI. When an Option is selected, its GUID should be included in a Choose instruction's Source list.

### 10. CleanList Instruction

Purpose: Reads a CSV file that specifies files to delete based on which mods are selected. Used for compatibility cleanups.

Properties:

- Action: "CleanList"
- Source: Path to the cleanlist CSV file
  - Should be a single CSV file path
  - Uses placeholders: `<<modDirectory>>` or `<<kotorDirectory>>`
  - First file in Source list is used (if multiple specified)
- Destination: Directory where files should be deleted from
  - Typically `<<kotorDirectory>>`/Override
  - Files listed in the CSV are deleted from this directory

**CSV File Format:**

Each line in the CSV: ModName,file1.ext,file2.ext,file3.ext,...

- First field: Name of the mod (used for matching against selected components)
- Remaining fields: Filenames to delete if that mod is selected

**Behavior:**

- Reads the cleanlist CSV file
- For each line in the file:
  - Extracts mod name (first field)
  - Extracts list of files to delete (remaining fields)
  - Checks if a mod matching that name is selected using fuzzy matching:
    - Exact match (case-insensitive)
    - Substring match
    - Token-based matching (requires 2+ shared tokens and 60% overlap)
  - If mod is selected, deletes all specified files from Destination directory
- Special case: Lines starting with "Mandatory Deletions" are always processed
- SetRealPaths is called with skipExistenceCheck=true
- Logs each file deleted and provides summary statistics
- Files that don't exist are skipped with verbose logging

**Fuzzy Matching Details:**

The mod name matching uses tokenization that:

- Converts to lowercase
- Removes punctuation
- Splits on whitespace
- Removes stop words: "by", "for", "the", "and", "of", "mod", "pack", "k1", "k2", "hd", "kotor", "version", etc.
- Applies crude singularization (removes trailing 's' from words longer than 3 chars)

**Example Usage:**

```toml
[[Instructions]]
Action = "CleanList"
Source = ["<<modDirectory>>/compatlist.csv"]
Destination = "<<kotorDirectory>>/Override"
```

**Example CSV Content:**

```csv
Mandatory Deletions,old_file1.tga,old_file2.tpc
HD UI Rewrite,ui_old.tga,ui_old.tpc
Weapon Model Overhaul,w_blaster_01.mdl,w_blaster_01.mdx
```

## Backwards Compatibility Notes

1. Destination Field:
   - Serialized for Extract, Move, Copy, Rename, Patcher, Delete, and CleanList
   - Not serialized for Execute, Run, DelDuplicate, or Choose
   - Some instructions serialize it but don't use it (legacy compatibility)

2. Overwrite Field:
   - Serialized for Move, Copy, and Rename only
   - Default value is 'true' if not specified
   - Delete instruction repurposes this for error handling mode

3. Arguments Field:
   - Serialized for DelDuplicate, Execute, and Patcher only
   - Each instruction type interprets it differently
   - Not used by other instruction types

4. Source Field:
   - Always serialized for all instruction types
   - For Choose: contains Option GUIDs (strings), not file paths
   - For others: contains file paths with optional wildcards
   - DelDuplicate uses it for compatible extensions list

5. Path Placeholders:
   - `<<modDirectory>>` replaced with MainConfig.SourcePath
   - `<<kotorDirectory>>` replaced with MainConfig.DestinationPath
   - Replacement happens in UtilityHelper.ReplaceCustomVariables()
   - Paths are only made absolute in Instruction.SetRealPaths() for security

6. Wildcard Support:
   - Supported in Source for: Extract, Move, Copy, Rename, Delete
   - Processed by PathHelper.EnumerateFilesWithWildcards()
   - Standard wildcards: * (multiple chars), ? (single char)

7. Case Sensitivity:
   - Controlled by MainConfig.CaseInsensitivePathing
   - Affects path resolution and file matching
   - Uses PathHelper.GetCaseSensitivePath() when enabled

8. Virtual File System:
   - Used during dry-run validation
   - Tracks file state as instructions execute
   - Must be initialized with InitializeFromRealFileSystemAsync()
   - Simulates file operations without touching disk
